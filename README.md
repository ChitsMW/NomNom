# NomNom Breastfeeding-tracker

## Purpose:
To create an app that tracks breast feeding sessions for nursing mothers.
## Tech Stack:
JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap, MongoDB, and Express.js.
## Team:
Solo project
## Description:
I used starter code to build this app. It allows the user to either manually input the nursing session, or turn on a real-time timer. Sessions are stored in a database and can be retrieved through a history. 
## Fun Fact:
This is my first time using React, MongoDB, and Express.js. 
## Still To Do:
I need to work on refining the timer, and connect the database to the frontend to have each session recorded in the session history table.
I would like to add more features to the app like bottle feedings and daily diaper changes. I would also like to deploy as a real website
